    <span style="color: black"><p> When the term Internet is used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected Internet Protocol (IP) networks, 
            the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter. 
            In common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. the internet. 
            Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective.
            The Internet is also often referred to as the Net, as a short form of network. Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, 
            meaning interconnected or interwoven. The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking, 
            meaning interconnecting computer networks.</p>
