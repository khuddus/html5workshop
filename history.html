    <span style="color: black"><p> Research into packet switching by Paul Baran and Donald Davies emerged in the early to mid-1960s,
                                  and packet switched networks such as the NPL network,ARPANET, Tymnet, the Merit Network,Telenet, and CYCLADES,
                                  were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET project led to the development of protocols for internet working,
                                  by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks. ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were 
                                     interconnected between the Network Measurement Center at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Henry Samueli School of Engineering and 
                                      Applied Science directed by Leonard Kleinrock, and the NLS system at SRI International (SRI) by Douglas Engelbart in Menlo Park, California, 
                                       on 29 October 1969. The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
                                      followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, fifteen sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end 
                                     of 1971. These early years were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing.</p>

      <p>Early international collaborations on the ARPANET were rare.
                European developers were concerned with developing the X.25 networks. Notable exceptions were the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) 
                in June 1973, followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the Tanum Earth Station and Peter T. Kirstein's research group in the
                United Kingdom, initially at the Institute of Computer Science, University of London and later at University College London.
                In December 1974, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, 
                used the term internet as a shorthand for internetworking and later RFCs repeated this use.Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981
                when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). 
                In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks.</p>
                   
            <p>TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer sites 
                in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s.
                Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. 
                By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of 
                the Internet to carry commercial traffic. The Internet rapidly expanded in Europe and Australia in the mid to late 1980s and to Asia in 
                the late 1980s and early 1990s.The beginning of dedicated transatlantic communication between the NSFNET and networks in Europe was 
                established with a low-speed satellite relay between Princeton University and Stockholm, Sweden in December 1988.Although other network 
                protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network</p>
